`EpiReplicants` is a repository of epidemiological models that try to mimic published examples. There are two underlying aims:

1. To demonstrate the ability (or lack thereof) to replicate/reproduce results, which is important for trust in these models and their applications.
2. To highlight the capability of Julia as a language for epidemiological modeling, and to identify gaps in the current ecosystem.

## Guidelines

- The implementation should be in Julia
- Written as a Quarto document
- In a subdirectory with its own environment
- Preferably based on an open publication where the code is available under a permissive license
